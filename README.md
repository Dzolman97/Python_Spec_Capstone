# Chocolate Coins - Paper Trading for Cryptocurrency
### A Capstone project for DevMountain Python Specialization


<h4>
Chocolate Coins is a Paper Trading Web app for Crypto Currency. It is named chocolate coins because I loved those things when I was younger and whenever I see pictures of Bitcoin or other types of digital currency it makes me think of those chocolate coins!
</h4>

<h4>
For the data side of this Project, it will need to capture correct pricing data for each coin that is decided to be put on here. It will also then need to update that pricing.
Then visualize it into a readable (hopefully interactive) chart.
</h4>

<h4>
For the "CRUD" and user capability side of things... This project will need to, create and hold users login and sign up info and encrypt the password, create the amount of "money" the want to use then update it as it goes up or down, create, update, delete what is in the users watchlist, create and update buy or sell orders, update or delete account information.
